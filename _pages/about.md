## Biography
I am an undergraduate student at the [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/), majoring in Mathematics and Physics + Civil Engineering and Systems.

I am interested in the intersection of computer science, physics, and art, with a focus on the development of new algorithms and tools for the creation of digital art of high-fidelity physical correctness as well as expressiveness.For more academic information, please refer to my [CV](/academic/files/cv.pdf).

I am also interested in implementing these new-tech tools as a creator, for which I have developed basic skills in digital art, music, and game design. For more information, please refer to my [portfolio](/academic/portfolio/).
