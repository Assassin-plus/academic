# Hobbies
My hobbies include playing the violin, calligraphy, film photography, and video games. 

I play Apex Legends, Cyberpunk 2077 (I have been an active [modder]() for this game), and rhythm games like Cytus II (follow and download Cytoid!) and Phigros.

I am a big fan of the [Three-body Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remembrance_of_Earth%27s_Past) series and [The Lord of the Rings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings).
